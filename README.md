# MY_CV-HTML_AND_CSS

This website is designed to show my basic HTML and CSS skills by making an usefull and user-friendly website, where further information about my career is shown.

Users will be able to navigate through the differents section and find out relevant information about me, my studies, work experiences, and so on.

In addition, users will be able to get in touch with me by filling out a form located in the "Contact me" section.
