## Future features

- One posible future future might be to give real functionaly to the get-in-touch form by setting up a javascript functionality in it.
- Another usefull functionality might be to change the navigation bar in mobile design, creating a drop-down menu, for example.

## Typography and color scheme

- __Typography__

    - "Source Sans Pro" from [Google Fonts] has been chosen as the main font for the entire website.
    - This font has been tested for all screen sizes and fit well to each of them. 
    - It gives a profesional and modern look to the webpage, which is what an online CV needs.


- __Color Scheme__

    - In order to pick the accurate color that better fit with the website, I've used [Color Adobe](https://color.adobe.com). Here I could generate a color palette and get all the necessary Hexadecimal Colors. 
    - I wanted to give my website a calming feel and profesionality, by selecting soft, muted colours and choosing images related to office enviroment.
    - Therefore, the soft green, which is used in most of the above-mentioned section, is the main colour chosen for the website, which is displayed throughout. 

## Wireframes


- [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) has been the tool used to generate the digital sketches of the initial website idea. 
- Below the sketch of the inital idea is shown. Some detail has been modified as the project progressed, such as the header image or the distribution of some content, in order to fit the text to the distribution of the elements.

## Technologies


- HTML and CSS: 
    - **HTML** is the standard markup language for Web pages.
    - **CSS** is the language we use to style and HTML document.
    - Both programing languages are the main technologies used in this project in order to create the webpage. 
- GitHub Pages: it is a static site hosting service. It take the code from a Github reposiroty and publishes a website. It will be explained in further detail in the [Deployment](#Deployment) section.
- GitPod: this tool has been chosen as the IDE of this project. It is a cloud development environment accessible via a browser, that can be run directly from the github repository.


## Testing

### Test cases and fixed bugs

- Tests have been done to each user story as well and in here, only few bugs have been found. These bugs are the following:
    - User story number 1: Half of the navigation bar was behind the main header image. To fix this, a z-index attribute has been set on the "<nav>" tag in the css.

    - User story number 3: some of the element widths were bad styled on mobile design. To fixed it, the element width has been calculated with the function "calc()".

    - User story number 5: two of the links within the footer section, on the confirmation page, redirected to a 404-not-found page. This bug has been fixed by setting the correct URL for those <a> elements that redirected to the wrong page.
    
    - User story number 6: on the contact form another bug was found related to the initial textarea value. It was a blank space, so the form could be submitted with an imput "message" input. To fix it, some blank spaces have been removed from the HTML within contact.html file.
    
### Code validation

- __HTML:__ Some errors ocurred after auditing every page with the official HTML validator: [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
    - Errors found on the index.html:
    ![index.html errors](./docs/html_validator_1.JPG)
    - Errors found on the contact.html:
    ![contact.html errors](./docs/html_validator_2.JPG)
    - Errors found on the confirmation.html:
    ![confirmation.html errors](./docs/html_validator_3.JPG)

All these bugs have been detected and fixed after the HTML validator testing, as were undetectable while testing the user stories. 

- __CSS:__ No errors ocurred after auditing the style sheet with the CSS validator: [CSS Validator](https://www.cssportal.com/css-validator/).

### Lighthouse - Dev Tools

- I have used Lighthouse from Google Chrome DevTools, to test my website performance and accesibility. The first testing scored 84%, as some audit failed. 
![first lighthouse reporter](./docs/lighthouse_desktop_1.JPG)

- Color contrast was one of them, and to improve this failure, some white texts (with a green background) have been modified to black. [Color Contrast recommendations](https://web.dev/color-contrast/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools)
- In addition, it was also recommended to add a discernible name to the footer links. [Links recommendations](https://web.dev/link-name/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools)

- Therefore, by fixing this found bugs the new lighthouse score is as follows:
![first lighthouse reporter](./docs/lighthouse_2_desktop.JPG)


### Supported screens and browsers

- The website was tested on the most common screen sizes. The sizes where possible erros could appeared were: 1200px, 900px and for mobile sizes (down 480px). For this reason, three different styles have been set for these three cases.

- The browsers where the website has been tested are Firefox and Google Chrome. In the case of the former, the tests have only carried out for desktop size. For the latter, tests for mobile and desktop sizes have been done. 


## Deployment

The website was deployed to GitHub pages. These are the steps to deploy it:
- Navigating to the GitHub repository settings tab, you will find the "Pages" tab.
- In this tab, choosing the main branch of the site and saving the changes it is enough to deploy.
- Once it has deployed (it could take 5-10 minutes) the site would be available on the URL shown in this "pages" tab. 
- The deployed URL for this project is the following: [Deployed URL](https://julamifra.github.io/MY_CV-HTML_AND_CSS/).
